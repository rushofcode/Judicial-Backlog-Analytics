# Judicial-Backlog-Analytics
## Project Overview
This project analyzes judicial infrastructure and case clearance efficiency across Indian states using state-level performance metrics.

## Business Questions
- Which states face the highest courtroom infrastructure shortages?
- How do High Court and Lower Court clearance rates compare?
- Is judicial manpower proportional to population burden?
- Does higher judicial spending improve efficiency?

## Dataset Source
State-level judicial capacity and clearance data (2022)

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas)
- Power BI
- Data Cleaning & Transformation

## Key Insights
-Several states report courthall shortfall levels exceeding 30%, highlighting significant infrastructure gaps that may contribute to delayed hearings and persistent judicial backlog.
-Lower courts demonstrate a higher average case clearance rate compared to high courts, indicating that case complexity and procedural delays may be more concentrated at higher judicial levels.
-States with a higher population-to-judge ratio at the high court level show signs of systemic capacity constraints, suggesting that judicial manpower shortages could be impacting overall efficiency.
-Increased per capita judicial spending does not consistently translate into improved clearance rates, implying that budget allocation effectiveness may depend more on structural reforms and resource distribution.
